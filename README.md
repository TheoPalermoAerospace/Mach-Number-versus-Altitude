# **Mach number versus altitude**

This code calculates the mach number according to the altitude given the speed of an aircraft, taking into account the temperature and air parameters such as the gas constant R and the gamma heat capacity ratio. The mach number according to the altitude, going from troposphere to stratosphere, can be visualized within the plot in the end of the code.
